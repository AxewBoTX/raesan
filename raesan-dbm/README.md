## Bugs

- new records insert refresh before deleting - for some reason that I can't seem to understand, whenever you add a new record, all the delete buttons of the records stop working and you have to refresh that page to get them to work again

## Todo

- implement updating records
- implementing rendering the latex body of questions
- integrate all the tables together both in frontend and backend for
  various CRUD operations
- proper error handling for the backend
- integrate testing into the backend and frontend (js only)
- proper error handling for backend-frontend communication to handle stuff life collisions between database records etc etc
- integrate toast notifications for everything
